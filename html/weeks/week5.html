            <h1>Week 5: 3D Printing</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> This week, I attempted to 3D print 3 objects, yet only two were "successful".</p>
            
            <h3>Spring Loaded Toilet Paper Holder Roll</h3>
            <p>Success!
                <br>
                For the past semester, each time I used the restroom in my partner's room, I always got annoyed at the fact that the toilet paper roll could not 
                maintain tension in its holder and would always fall off. So, I decided to 3D print a spring loaded toilet paper roll holder.
                <br>                <br>

                I got the design for the spring loaded roll through Thingiverse, and the link can be found here: ____. 
                <br>                <br>


                The design came in 3 pieces, the larger roll piece, the smaller roll piece, and a sizing cap. I loaded each of these pieces into PrusaSlicer, and
                then sliced them, including supports on the two roll pieces. I actually ended up having a print fail for the first time I printed the sizing cap, see image below. 
                Once all the pieces were printed out in PLA, (each of the large pieces took about 2 hours). I removed them off teh build plate and then removed the 
                support material from the inside. Unfortunately, I accidentally ripped the top nub off one of the large roll pieces off when taking off the supports, so 
                I used a 3Doodler, a 3D printing pen, to seal the nub back onto the main body of the roll. 
                <br>                <br>


                I then assembled the roll by putting the sizing cap on the smaller roll piece, and then putting the larger roll piece on top of the smaller roll piece, with a spring in the middle.
                It worked great!

            <h3>Ball in a Cage Pendant</h3>
            <p>Success!
                <br> <br>
                My second print was a ball in a cage pendant. I wanted to explore 3D printed items that were embedded 
                within each other, and so I followed a tutorial on youtube to create a ball stuck within a cage pendant. 
                <br>                 <br>

                Here is the stl file: ____.
                <br>
                <br>

                Here is the youtube link: _____.
                <br>
                <br>
                This print almost worked, but I think I set the infill to be too small of a value and the bottom of the ball came off
                due to unknown factors, as it was already removed by the nezxt time I went to check on it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This project was fun to CAD up, and fun to print, but it mostly served as a proof of concept for the project that I actually wanted to code up, which was a ball that could move through a caged loop.
