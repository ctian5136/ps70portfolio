            <h1>Week 3: Kinetic Golden Tree Sculpture</h1>
            <p>For week 3, I created a golden tree sculture out of brass and metal shims, brass wire, and a brass tube.
                To create the tree, first hot glue the main brass wire branches onto the brass tubing that has been cut down to size.
                Then, wrap the brass wire around the branches of the tree and secure using pliers if your fingers don't happen to be strong enough.
                To create the leaves, use brass and metal shim and cut out tiny leaf shaped pieces that you can then hot glue onto your brances. 
                Add additional branches and leaves as you see fit.
                <br>
                To assemble, use foam to mount the motor by its rectangular gearbox and to hide some of the wiring below. 
                You should ensure that the brass tubing is the same size as the little knob on your motor (name tbd) and slide the tree onto the motor.
                <br>
                For circuitry, hook up an ESP to a breadboard with a potentiometer that is then hooked to the motor driver and then the motor. 
                <br>
                Final Step: watch it spin

            <p>The voltage through the potentiometer varies between 0 and 5 based on which direction the user is turning the dial towards. I noticed that as I turn it in the "off" direction, the voltage increases and as I turned in the "on" direction, the voltage decreased. This was confusing but it might have been because the encoding of the motor driver and the MCU set speed to be 255-s. However, I'm not totally sure haha. I will look into this in the next week's assignment. 
                <br>
                Using Ohms Law, I = V/R, I know that the V would between 0 and 5, however I'm not too sure about the Resistance and will ask about this in OH.
